SFarm.io is the farming data reward design project based on token economy and blockchain technology. 
Data integrity and data availability with end-to-end traceability are the very important properties to SFarm platform 
for all stakeholders.

SFarm mobile dapp is the dashboard to participate, monitor, and predict the crops supply with sovereign identity 
and tamper proof data. When the farmers provide their identity data and farming data and the validators will 
authorize to be 'true', the farmers will get SFT(SFarm Tokens).
